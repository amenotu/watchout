#Watchout
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair. This is a simple game created using Javascript, D3.js, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to move the alien spaceship using the mouse cursor to avoid the asteroids. The longer you last without getting hit, the higher your score. Get hit though and your spaceship explodes!
