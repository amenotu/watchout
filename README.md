#Watchout
This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).

The goal is to move the alien spaceship using the mouse cursor to avoid the asteroids. The longer you last without getting hit, the higher your score. Get hit though, your spaceship explodes and your score resets to zero.

This game was created using D3.js, a popular data manipulation library that is often used to display and animate data in interactive ways. In the game, I leverage many of the D3.js library's data manipulation methods to animate the asteroids and make the player draggable. 

#Requirements
